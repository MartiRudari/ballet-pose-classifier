# Ballet Pose Classification Using LSTM â€“ Research Article

This repository contains the research paper **"LSTM RNN for Ballet Sequences"**, written as part of my Bachelor's studies in Computer Engineering.

The paper explores the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify ballet movements in real time using MediaPipe for pose detection. As a former professional ballet dancer, I merged technical skill and artistic discipline to create a tool that could assist dancers in training, accuracy, and creative development.

## Key Highlights
- Real-time classification of 6 ballet poses
- Pose data collected using MediaPipe Holistic
- LSTM model trained with high accuracy (>80%)
- Potential applications in dance training, choreography, and generative AI

## Future Work
- Uploading code and dataset (currently in preparation)
- Adding visual demos and training notebooks
